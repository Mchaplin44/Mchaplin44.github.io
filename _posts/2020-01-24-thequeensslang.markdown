My journey to  becoming a software engineering  has not been an easy one.  Every coders journey is uniquely strenuous. From learning computer logic to define  english words with new meanings and it feels like i'm learning japanese or some kind of semetic language! The  Computer logic side, is hard, but  is very similar to human logic it's just like teaching a new born baby to do complicated tasks. Yea I know, teaching babies is hard, sounds like an impossible task but if you have any kind of pedagogical thought it's not as hard you think just takes patience. I know I used to be a school teacher.  Understanding the logic is just kinda hard for me, But what is EXTREMELY hard is understanding each coding  languages syntax. 

What is Syntax?  Syntax is defined as the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language.  In computer programming its defined as a set of rules for or an analysis of the syntax of a language. Well pretty much the same thing right? "Cause" it is. You must be able to understand patterns between  words, sentences and format.  If you don't, in your "native"  language,  person to person and  in computer language person to computer the receiver won't understand you.  If the computer or human cannot understand your syntax then you are doomed  to a life of  misunderstandings. Guess who has been doomed to that life. You got it right, ME. Well, and all my peers with similar backgrounds. 

I have always had a hard time with the english language since I was a child. Simply because I was raised in an area where what you said was always clarified by "You feel me" or " get where im coming from". In different ethnic groups whose orignal native language is not English and in communities where we practice dialect called "Slang' in america. We dont often use correct Syntax for "The Queen's English" . This unfortunate coincidence gives me a hard time understanding any syntaxial agreements, Which inturn makes Learning Code EVEN HARDER.
