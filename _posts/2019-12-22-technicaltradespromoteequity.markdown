When we hear the term racial equity what comes to mind?  The government  instituting policy to give out  reparations checks and  land, maybe a free car to get back and forth  to work for all historically marginalized groups.  "Racial equity" also referred to as "Social Equity" is defined as, the concern  with justice and fairness of social policy. Since the 1960s, the concept of social equity has been used in a variety of institutional contexts, including education and public administration.  Though it has been on the radar of the American government to  improve institutions to be more conducive of social equity, practices has not been vastly  implemented.  I believe that social equity is needed for those of  marginalized groups to succeed in an extremely competitive job market, and it's time to make it happen! My journey to software engineering started with the search for equitable vehicles to create  high value within my skill set  to be better marketable to employers. This extremely important to my well being because I am a member of one americans most marginalized groups, African Americans.

All  Masters in any technical trades have two major  advantages over  non technical professionals. They are extremely important to an employer because their roles require specific skills, which means they cannot be easily replaced. Also,  if they are not able to get a positon they can always leverage their  trade and make money by servicing the general public in an unsaturated market. .  Software engineering is a technical trade that makes you an asset to any modern day corporation.  This was the match  that sparked my interest in coding. 
 
I am originally an educator.  I loved my students,  loved my co workers, loved to teach, hated the pay and hated the system.  I resigned to run my non-profit, Supporting ( S.Q.U.A.D Inc) full time and learn skill.  Its  a career  and character  development program for black youth .   I wanted to learn a skill that would be both  beneficial for my career that doubles  as a skill  I could learn to  teach the young men in my organization.   As you can  see by how I Praised earlier, I chose software engineering. 

I went to an event at Wework that was organized by Rodney Sampson's non-profit, Opportunity hub and Flatiron school. This event was named "Tech to wealth forum tour". The speakers explained how tech is one of the greatest opportunities for black people in america to get a shot at true generational wealth. This in depth conversation explained the reasons ave to find equitable pathways rather than traditional to get ahead economically and careers in tech pay way more than the cost to learn. Then they explained the framework  of Flatiron School. I fell in love with the structure, but I was a bit skeptical on me actually getting a job.

I took a chance and took a shot at it! I did some research and joined.  Now i'm in the online program  part-time. This has been a  journey, but I consider this more than a shot at  a  new career, I consider this a true opportunity to create wealth for myself, my family  and community. Even though it does feel like I  skydived off a building Im up for the challenges to come!
